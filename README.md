# Placement Diary

This is web-based version of a placement diary that can easily run on a phone, so that it is readily available to the student to make notes as they are doing the work, and then edit later (perhaps on a desktop).

## Self Evaluation

 I am now taking a moment to critically evaluate the work I have done on my coursework. This evaluation aims to provide an honest reflection on the strengths and weaknesses of my project, highlighting both the accomplishments and areas for improvement.

### Accomplishments and Things I Did Well

1. Clean and Modular Code: Throughout the development process, I prioritized writing clean and modular code. This approach not only makes the project easier to understand but also enhances maintainability, allowing for potential future updates and additions.
2. Documentation: I made sure to provide comprehensive documentation for the project, including the code structure, functions, and usage instructions. This documentation will be valuable for myself and others who may work on the project in the future.
3. Version Control: Throughout the development process, I utilized version control (e.g., Git) effectively. Regular commits and branching helped me manage changes efficiently and collaborate with team members.
4. User Interface Design: I put considerable effort into designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Even though my interface is very simple and limited, the application's layout is clear and well-organized, ensuring a positive user experience.

### Areas for Improvement

1. Extra Features: There were some additional features that I would have liked to incorporate, but due to time constraints, I had to prioritize the essential aspects. These extra features could have enhanced the overall appeal and utility of the application.
2. Time Management: Throughout the development process, I faced challenges in managing my time effectively. Due to academic commitments and other responsibilities, I had limited hours to work on the project each day. Consequently, some planned features and enhancements had to be postponed or omitted entirely. To address this issue, I could have created a more detailed project timeline, breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable chunks with specific deadlines. This approach would have allowed me to prioritize tasks and allocate time more efficiently.

In conclusion, even though the absence of a database presented challenges, I am proud of the work I accomplished on the project. The experience allowed me to learn valuable lessons about project management, prioritization, and working within constraints. In the future, I look forward to expanding my skills and revisiting this project with the addition of a database to address the aforementioned areas for improvement.
